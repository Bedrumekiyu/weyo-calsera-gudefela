      Hello! My name is Bedru, and I am currently a software engineering student. I have always been fascinated by
      technology and how it shapes our world, which led me to pursue this field. Through my studies, I am gaining a solid
      foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and software development methodologies. I enjoy tackling complex
      problems and finding innovative solutions, and I am excited to apply my skills in real-world projects. In addition
      to my academic pursuits, I am eager to collaborate with others and learn from their experiences in the tech
      industry.

    <h2 class="experience-title">My Work Experience</h2>
    <p class="experience-text">
      During my time as a software engineering intern at XYZ Tech Solutions, I had the opportunity to work on various
      projects that enhanced my technical skills and provided valuable industry experience. I collaborated with a team of
      developers to design and implement a web application that streamlined the client onboarding process, resulting in a
      30% reduction in processing time. My responsibilities included writing clean, efficient code in JavaScript and
      Python, conducting code reviews, and participating in Agile ceremonies such as daily stand-ups and sprint planning.
      Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with version control systems like Git and learned to effectively
      communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. This internship not only honed my programming
      abilities but also taught me the importance of teamwork and adaptability in a fast-paced environment.
