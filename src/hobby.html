        <p class="intro-text">Hello, my name is Bedru, and I am passionate about making a positive impact in my community.
          With a strong belief in the power of education, I strive to inspire others to pursue their dreams and reach their
          full potential. My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences that have taught me the value of resilience and
          hard work. I enjoy engaging with people from different backgrounds, as it broadens my perspective and enriches my
          understanding of the world. In my free time, I love reading, exploring new ideas, and volunteering for various
          causes. I am committed to personal growth and lifelong learning, always seeking opportunities to expand my
          knowledge. Ultimately, I aspire to be a mentor and role model for future generations, helping them navigate their
          paths to success. I believe that together, we can create a brighter future for our community and beyond.</p>
